HIERARCHY:
Hieararcy is as follows:
Users have courses
Courses have Instructors and Exams
Exams have QuestionAndAnswers

STORING A PARTICULAR USER'S COURSES:
System allows us to find a lesson only from the name, so here courses are stored only with their names. So to courses to be stored in the
general courses list with full information (their name, instructorsText, examsText) is enough.



****ERROR HELPER PART****
it tells 0_instructor because you are storing indexes instead of names in 1_courselist
